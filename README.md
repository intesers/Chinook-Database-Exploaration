# Chinook-Database-Exploaration
Exploring the Chinook database as my first full fledged data analysis project. I have explored the raw data using SQL, then presented the reports in MS Excel and finally I visualized the data using Tableau. The visualization file is included here and also available to see in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sakir.inteser/viz/ChinookDatabaseReport/Dashboard1)

As this is my first data analysis project, any kind of feedback or constructive criticism is very much appreaciated. 

The Chinook database can be found [here](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database)
